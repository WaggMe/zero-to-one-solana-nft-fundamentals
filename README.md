# zero-to-one-solana-nft-fundamentals

There are a plenty of introductions to Solana, and to the culture and technology behind NFTs. Many of these fall into three categories:
1. **guides for newcomers** (focus on the technical basics and guides to your first actions so you can enter the ecosystem and participate as a trader/collecter)
2. **guides for new project teams** (focus on the latest technical tools and how to launch projects on-chain to prepare you to build and launch a new project)
3. **guides for technical experts** (focus on the latest technical tools, how to launch projects on-chain, and why Solana / Sol-NFTs are different from other ecosystems. Goal is to prepare you to build at a deep on-chain level)

This guide is different. It's aimed at a fourth group (⭐) that wants to build near or around the chain, or that are technical experts in other areas but new to Crypto, Blockchain, Solana, and/or NFTs. The group highlighted in the table below wants to understand "what makes this tech new/novel/different, AND what do I need to know to build near it, extend it, or analyze it".
